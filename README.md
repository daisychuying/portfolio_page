Portfolio site
In this project, I created a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built.

The site contains a portfolio page to display all my projects, an about page to share my contact info and my skills, and projects pages to show details for each project.

When user hover over the button, the background color will change to light grey.
I also changed the background color of portfolio page, the font size and color of intro-paragraph in about page, and color of project name in the main page.
